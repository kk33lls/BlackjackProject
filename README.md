# BlackjackProject
## Description
This appplication was written using Java programming language and it's object oriented design to mimic playing the game of Blackjack. 

When the application begins the dealer deals two cards to itself and the player. The player is able to view both of their cards face up and the program tells the player the value of their hand then prompts the user for the choice to "hit" or "stand." The logic embeded in this application continously evaulates the player's hand value and ends the player's turn when they either bust or request to "stand". When the player opts to "stand", the dealer is then given logic that makes them continue drawing cards while under a hand value of 17, and determines the winner based around the logic of a typical blackjack game.

## Technologies Used
 - Java
 - Eclipse
 - Git/Github
 - Sublime Text Editor
 - zsh

  ## Concepts Applied
 - Enumeration
 - Superclasses
 - Object oriented programming  (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation)
 - Switch
 - Loops, conditionals

 ## Lessons Learned
Biggest lesson learned here was to debug sooner than later. I decided to wait until later on to re-run my code and still make sure everything was working only to figure out there were still some bugs in it that needed fixing. Next time, I will make sure to do this earlier on. Secondly, I should make a plan of how I want to write out my code before doing so to keep it cleaner and concise, I think it got a bit meesy for a moment, probably leading to some of the bugs.
